# What is this project about?
This project makes an API for the temperature of some weather stations. This is just as a demonstration on how to make an API along with the front end HTML program.

## API KEYS
Normally, the homepage will redirect you with the 'demo_key' API Key. You can generate your own API Key, you need to run:
```
python ./generate_api_key.py
```
This prints out the API key aswell.
